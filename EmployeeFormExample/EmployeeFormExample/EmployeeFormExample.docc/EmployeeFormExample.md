## Overview

![ImageDataPicker](ImageDataPicker-Header)

The ``EmployeeFormExample`` demonstrates how to use the ImageDataPicker framework to create a form for editing employee information. The form includes fields for the employee's name, email, and phone number, as well as a photo picker for selecting an image from the photo library. The ImageDataPicker framework provides a convenient way to bind an image to SwiftData with a control that allows you to select a photo using the PhotosUI `PhotosPicker`.
